## 0.1.5 - UNRELEASED

## 0.1.4 - 11 May 2016

It is now possible to set a prefix for a job; typically used to identify the job (much like a thread name).

An alternate, simplified implementation of the status board is now available as
`com.walmartlabs.active-status.minimal-board/minimal-status-board`. This is suitable for use
during development, when a proper terminal is not available.

Added a simple component wrapper around the status board.

## 0.1.3 - 05 Feb 2016

Added `*terminal-type*` Var, to override default terminal type passed to the `tput` command.

There status board now refreshes at an interval (that defaults to 100ms), rather than
after every change.
This greatly reduces the amount of output to `*out*`.

Because of the optimizations to output, the job channels are no longer lossy.

## 0.1.2 - 02 Feb 2016

Fix bug where status would be indented by one space.

## 0.1.0 - 28 Jan 2016

Initial release.
