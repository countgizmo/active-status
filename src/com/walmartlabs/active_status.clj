  The status board presents the status of any number of jobs.
  In this implementation, each job has a line in the status board, and
  can be updated individually and asynchronously.

  Each job has a summary message,
  an optional status (:normal, :success, :warning, :error),
  and optional progress state.

  The job's status control the font color for the entire line.
  If progress state exists, then a progress bar is included for the job.

  The board is presented using simple text, and updates in place, using terminal capability
  strings to position the cursor, clear existing content on a line, and so forth.

  The status board runs as a core.async process.

  This function returns a channel; the channel can be passed to [[add-job]].

  Close the returned channel to shut down the status board immediately.

  Note that when testing in the REPL, you may see slightly odd output as the REPL
  will return and print nil *before* the final update to the status board. Adding
  a short sleep after closing the status board channel, but before returning, is
  useful in the REPL.

  configuration
  : The configuration to use for the status board, defaulting to [[default-configuration]].

  The console status board depends on the `tput` command to be present on the system path;
  it invokes `tput` in a sub-shell to obtain terminal capabilities.  In addition, if the `TERM`
  environment variable is not set, a default, `xterm`, is passed to `tput`."

  The primary job update is just a String, which changes the summary text for the job.

  Other update objects can change the visible status of the job, or enable and update
  a progress bar specific to the job. Functions such as [[change-status]] and
  [[start-progress]] return job update values that can be put into the job's channel.

  Example:

  It will highlight for a moment as well.
