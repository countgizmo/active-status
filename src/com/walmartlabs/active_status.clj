  can be updated asynchronously.

  Each job has a summary message,
  an optional status (:normal, :success, :warning, :error),
  and optional progress state.

  The board is presented using text and updates in place, using terminal capability
  strings (to, for example, position the cursor and clear line content).

  The presentation includes the summary message; the status controls
  the font (that is, the color) for the message.  If progress state
  exists, then a progress bar is included for the job.

  The status board runs as a core.async process.

  This function returns a channel; the channel can be passed to [[add-job]].

  Close the returned channel to shut down the status board immediately.

  "Adds a new job, returning a channel for updates to the job.

  You may put updates into the job's channel, or close the channel, to terminate the job.

  The primary job update is just a String, which changes the summary text for the job.

  Other update objects can change the visible status of the job, or enable and update
  a progress bar specific to the job. Functions such as [[change-status]] and
  [[start-progress]] return job update values that can be put into the job's channel.

  Example:

      (require '[com.walmartlabs.active-status :as as]
               '[clojure.core.async :refer [close! >!!]])

            (close! job-ch)))

  When a job is changed in any way, it will briefly be highlighted (in bold font).
  If not updated for a set period of time (by default, 1 second) it will then dim (normal font).

  On a heavily loaded system, updates into the channel may be discarded (using a sliding buffer).
  This is preferable to having jobs block or park just to report their status.

  A terminated job will stay visible, but is moved up above any non-terminated jobs.
